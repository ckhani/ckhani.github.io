This Twine repository takes the user back in time to experience the history and time period of King Henry VIII. Essentially a role playing game as a traveler, the user is able to embark on an hilarious adventure while still maintaining the factual and educational aspect of the game. My Twine Narrative uses at minimum 7 or 8 of the mini assignments allowing the user to have an immersive experience throughout the game with the user being able to give motivation to its future self. Not only that, With images to keep the user engaged my repository can be completed rather slowly as there is a lot to unpack in certain slides that can be key turning points to the story.
